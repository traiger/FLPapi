# FLPapi
Using Weather Underground API to display temperature on Four Letter Phat.

**Disclaimer**
**I don't really know what I'm doing, I'm sharing this because I couldn't find an example displaying info from an API on the Four Letter Phat.**

Useful code written by @sacmoses.

Messy stuff attempted by me.

Attempted to get the information to scroll but had no luck.
