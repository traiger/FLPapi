# FLPapi
Using Weather Underground API to display temperature on Four Letter Phat.

**Disclaimer** I don't really know what I'm doing, I'm sharing this because I couldn't find an example of displaying info from an API on the Four Letter Phat display.

Bulk of useful code written by sacmoses.

Messy stuff attempted by me.
