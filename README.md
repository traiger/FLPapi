# FLPapi
Using Weather Underground API to display weather information on Four Letter Phat. You can get an API key and see documentation <a/href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?MR=1">here</a>.

**Disclaimer
<br>Beginner here, I'm sharing this because I couldn't find an example that display information from an API on the Four Letter Phat.**

Useful code written by @sacmoses.

Messy stuff by me.

Next I want to display the temperature and the time and have them scroll by. If you have any ideas please let me know!
